    <textOnly>Dear {!Opportunity.OwnerFirstName},

Congratulations on closing {!Opportunity.Name} with {!Opportunity.Account}. It is critical to get the customer onboarded as soon as possible and the Customer Success team will email the License and provide access to the Support Portal right away.

We need your help with a few critical next steps:

Please introduce the Customer Onboarding team member assigned to the customer, using this email template (or write your own, using the same key points as the template).
Attend the Internal Debrief that Customer Success will coordinate in the next week.
Participate in the Onboarding Kickoff Call coordinated by Customer Success.

After you introduce Customer Success, we will coordinate the customer onboarding communication with the customer. Weâ€™ll include you and the SE as attendees on any calls/meetings for continuity and context.
The Internal Debrief is a critical, brief meeting that prepares the Customer Success team with the proper background that they will need to drive the Onboarding, and record details to allow us to provide more targeted guidance. Please be prepared to address the following topics:

Key stakeholders - Project Team, Project/Initiative Owner, Business Sponsor, Champion(s), etc.
Customer level of knowledge/skills
Use case, challenges, success criteria, milestones, etc.
Deal content confirmation, including any Professional Services

Prior to the Internal Debrief, Customer Success will review the Opportunity and linked Opportunity Doc (please ensure the Customer Onboarding team member assigned to this Onboarding has access to that document).

Thank you.
