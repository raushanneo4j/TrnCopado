    <subject>Salesforce will be unavailable (inaccessible, under construction) for most of this weekend.</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello Neo4j Salesforce constituents,

Salesforce will be unavailable (down for maintenance) this upcoming weekend. We anticipate Salesforce being unavailable for at least 12-hours between:

Downtime starts:

San Francisco, CA, USA PST (UTC -8) Sat, Jan 9, 2021 9:00 am
Malmö, Sweden CET (UTC +1) Sat, Jan 9, 2021 6:00 pm

Downtime ends:

San Francisco, CA, USA PST (UTC -8) Sat, Jan 9, 2021 9:00 pm
Malmö, Sweden CET (UTC +1) Sun, Jan 10, 2021 6:00 am


What to expect after &quot;downtime ends&quot;
We will send two more emails (one when downtime begins and another when it ends).  The downtime this weekend allows us to add these features below :

ARR Auto calculated using term dates and/or contract months. Reps will not be able to edit, but do not have to figure out how to calc ARR
ARR calculated in both local currency and USD (visible and reportable)
New Sales stage - 98% Sales Ops Review. This is the sales stage that reps will move opps to. The 99% will be renamed to Finance Review. Finance will move opps to 100% (closed won).
Terms Information section will be moved to the product line item. These fields include term start and end date, contract months, Payment terms, Invoice Frequency, etc...


If after Monday anyone notices anything unusual with their reports or new features then contact me or salesforce@neo4j.com with any questions.  Thanks all.</textOnly>
