    <textOnly>Hello Salesforce Users!

**WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW**

New BANT Fields (Budget, Authority, Need, Timing) are live in Salesforce! Find them in the &apos;Deal Information&apos; section of the Opportunity page.

These fields will be used by the sales management team to review SAOs for approval to move to 10%.

Please let us know if you have any questions by reaching out to us at salesforce@neo4j.com.

Thank you,
Salesforce Team</textOnly>
