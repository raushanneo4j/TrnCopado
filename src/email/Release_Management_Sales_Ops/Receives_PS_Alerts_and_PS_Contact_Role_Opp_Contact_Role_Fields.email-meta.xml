    <subject>Upcoming Change: New Professional Services Fields on Contact Roles</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello Salesforce Users!
This change primarily concerns the Professional Service team. Other users are copied for visibility, but we welcome your feedback!

**WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW**

Two New PS-specific Fields will go live in Salesforce on 12/4/2021!

Both fields are located on Opportunity Contact Roles (Contacts you add to Opportunities).

&apos;PS Contact Role&apos; - this picklist field works just like the standard &apos;Role&apos; field, except that the roles are specific to PS projects. PS users will select the value that best reflects a given contactâ€™s role as it relates to the specific project(s) on the opportunity:

Project Sponsor
Project Manager
Project Lead
Technical Consultant
Business Administrator.



&apos;Receives PS Alerts&apos; - this is a checkbox the PS team will use to tag contact roles on opportunities, so that the designated contacts can  receive automated project status alerts and other information related to their projects.

Please let us know if you have any questions by reaching out to us at salesforce@neo4j.com.

Thank you,
Salesforce Team</textOnly>
