    <subject>SMALL CORRECTION! Important: AuraDS Product Changes in Salesforce</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello Salesforce Users!

This alert is intended for users who add products to opportunities in Salesforce, report on products, and especially for users whose reports reference &apos;Neo4j - AuraDS&apos; product name in their filters.

The two changes outlined below are scheduled to take place on Thursday, January 13th.


**WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW**

The existing Product &quot;Neo4j - AuraDS&quot; is being renamed to &quot;Neo4j - AuraDS - Multi-Tenant&quot;.

New SKU,&quot;Neo4j - AuraDS - VPS Isolated&quot;, is being added to SFDC.

This change will impact any report that references product names in itse filters, specifically &apos;&apos;Neo4j - AuraDS&quot; -- the product records will be omitted from the report results.

If you reference product names in your reports, please update your report filters by replacing &quot;Neo4j - AuraDS&quot; with &quot;Neo4j - AuraDS - Multi-Tenant&quot; AND adding &quot;Neo4j - AuraDS - VPS Isolated&quot;.


Please let us know if you have any questions by reaching out to us at salesforce@neo4j.com.

Thank you,
Salesforce Team</textOnly>
