    <subject>Action required before January 8th (Steps to prepare for upcoming Salesforce Downtime)</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello Neo4j Salesforce constituents,

Salesforce will be unavailable (down for maintenance) for a 12-hour window between:

Downtime starts:

San Francisco, CA, USA PST (UTC -8) Sat, Jan 9, 2021 9:00 am
Malmö, Sweden CET (UTC +1) Sat, Jan 9, 2021 6:00 pm

Downtime ends:

San Francisco, CA, USA PST (UTC -8) Sat, Jan 9, 2021 9:00 pm
Malmö, Sweden CET (UTC +1) Sun, Jan 10, 2021 6:00 am


Your Action is Required before &quot;downtime starts&quot;:

Follow the steps below to move your Reports to a &quot;shared&quot; Folder, such as &quot;Public Folder&quot; or &quot;Unfiled Public Reports&quot;

Steps:

1. List your &quot;Private Reports&quot; by clicking &quot;Run&quot; on this page: https://neo4j.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Report/00O4o000004NspyEAC/view

2. For each row,  click the &quot;Name&quot; then &gt; &quot;Edit&quot; &gt; &quot;Properties&quot; &gt; and change the Folder to any of: &quot;Unfiled Public Reports&quot;, _or_ &quot;Public Folder&quot;,  and save. Either option works (the former if you&apos;re in Classic, and the latter if you&apos;re in Lightning)

3. Repeat step #1 through 3, which we cannot do for you due to sfdc limitations.



What happens if you do nothing between now and &quot;downtime starts&quot;?

If you take no actions before &quot;downtime starts&quot;, we cannot do that step for you; meaning any Reports listed for you in step 1 may likely break, especially if they pertain to Opportunity or Opportunity Product lines;  &quot;Break&quot; in this context means &quot;will likely lose columns/filters/groupings&quot;.

What to expect after &quot;downtime ends&quot;
If everything goes to plan, then after downtime ends there will be new features (bulleted below) in salesforce and only the subset of Reports found in &quot;shared&quot; folders will be upgraded automatically to be compatible with the new features, which are:

ARR Auto calculated using term dates and/or contract months. Reps will not be able to edit, but do not have to figure out how to calc ARR

ARR calculated in both local currency and USD (visible and reportable)

New Sales stage - 98% Sales Ops Review. This is the sales stage that reps will move opps to. 
The 99% will be renamed to Finance Review. Finance will move opps to 100% (closed won).

Terms Information section will be moved to the product line item. These fields include term start and end date, contract months, Payment terms, Invoice Frequency, etc...



If you have any questions, please reach me or salesforce@neo4j.com for wider coverage.
Happy holidays!</textOnly>
