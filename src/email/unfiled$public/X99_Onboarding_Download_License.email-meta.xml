    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},

I want to take this opportunity to thank you again for choosing to partner with Neo4j. Please know that our entire company is committed to making your implementation of Neo4j a resounding success.

To get you on-boarded as a new customer, we first need to ensure you have the latest Neo4j Enterprise product downloads available. Please use the following links to download the appropriate packages:

Linux/Mac: http://www.neo4j.com/customer/download/neo4j-enterprise-3.5.12-unix.tar.gz
Windows: http://www.neo4j.com/customer/download/neo4j-enterprise-3.5.12-windows.zip

Note: There is no license key. There is an acknowledgement of the license agreement that you will be asked to click through during the installation, which you can now freely do.

We also want to make sure you have access to Neo4j Customer Support as soon as possible. Please provide us with a list of names and email addresses for folks who will need Support Portal access. Once we have that, our support team will set those up right away.

As a next step, you can expect an email in the next few days introducing your Customer Success team, and information about your New Customer Onboarding journey.

Please reach out with any questions or issues accessing the software.

Sincerely,
{!Opportunity.OwnerFullName}</textOnly>
