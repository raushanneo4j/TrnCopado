Dear Salesforce Users, 

In order to enable OKTA for Salesforce, all usernames with "neotechnology.com" domain must be updated to "neo4j.com". 

This change is expected to take place by the end of this week. 

Following the update, you will receive a password reset link and be able to log in to Salesforce as usual using your updated username: firstname.lastname@neo4j.com

Best, 
Salesforce Team
