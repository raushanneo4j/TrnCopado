    <description>SFDC-0488_AuraProvisioningEmailForLanceKajiV1. This field exists to workaround an unplanned salesforce 13+ year old SFDC GA limitation: https://trailblazer.salesforce.com/ideaView?id=08730000000BrUAAA0.  The accuracy of this field needs to be recalculated if product names ever change!   Rule of thumb:  retire products, dont rename them , technically-speaking.  This text field exists so that rollups can refer to it,  because rollups cannot refer to formula fields.  At time of writing we will do a one-time mass update into this field and maintain it with synchronous logic at the OpportunityLineItem level.</description>
